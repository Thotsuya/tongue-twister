Hello, nice to meet you.

I successfully run a localization company that translates the client's content into different languages.

I am at the point where I would like to expand my company and reach out to more clients.

About:
- We are a group of insider scholars who are translating aside because every one of us is working as a professional in our field.  You will find no better person who knows about the topic you want to translate than us because we only match translators who are actively working in your specifically-wanted area.  We did not start as a company, but rather as a small reunion of quality translators, so we are proud of our excellence in translation. We guarantee the best quality to you.



Pros of my company:
- We cover both document and audiovisual content (ex. books, clinical history, research papers, videos)
- We cover all educational content from K-12 to every university subject.
- Our most requested localization is related to medicine and health: professional medical doctors currently working in the field will take care of the translation of research, medical papers, and any related content.
- We have a strong engineering team and professional engineers in the field will take care of the content to be localized to the correct terms.
- Our finance and marketing team working in their field using their marketing terms as their native language will go over the files word by word.
- School teachers of the K-12 range who are actively working in schools will go over your educational materials.
- We only hire translators that have either or both Master's and PhD or Professional degrees (ex. Doctor in Medicine, Doctor or Law)
- Since we are professionals in the field, we can give you our feedback from the perspective of active professionals.
- Sometimes content should be changed or modified due to the country's needs and wants. We are active professionals in the field in each country that speaks the language you want your files to be translated. We can work with you and give you consulting, to fit content into the native fit.
- Average years of advanced-level studies in the field: 7+ years
- Average years of experience in the field: 8+ years
- Various languages covered: English, Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, 
-  We give localization ourselves, matching the tone and vibe. The biggest issue that people face with Korean language translation is, that there are so many language styles, tones, and sentence structures. There are +9 different respect forms to call someone, and a tiny letter at the end of the sentence changes the tone completely. Having multiple unrelated translators in the team will cause so much trouble to fix the errors and make the whole project done by one person. We are fully equipped with experience in language style, localization, tone, and sentence structure and share our feedback before we start a huge project. Therefore, there will be NO NEED to do localization because IT IS ALREADY DONE.
-  We are fast. My team will review the work before the deadline and turn it in to you, so there will be even less work for you to do. We would like to see the project first, but we would not need 1 year to finish the project, in this way we save a few months to return the project to the highest quality possible.

Additional queries:


I want a website that is informatic, visual, catchy, and conveys the vibe that this is a scholar-level professional.

The basic colors are blue and white, you can add one additional color, after my confirmation.

You should be able to use AI for image and video production for the website, fitting the best images for each marketing of the company. You should create by yourself first and then will get confirmation from me. If you have additional ideas, feel free to talk to me. 

How long will it take for you? Describe how you will build the website in detail and how to improve it, write it via Upwork. I will read through all your messages, as I am interviewing various persons, and then choose the best-fitting web developer who gives me the best proposal.

I also run different businesses, and if you are good with this first project, I will give you the work of creating websites for and managing these businesses also. So, it will be a long-term project.
